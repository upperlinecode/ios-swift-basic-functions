//: Playground - noun: a place where people can play

// Level 1:
// Here's a function that takes in a number and returns a string telling whether the number is positive or negative.
func isItPositive(x: Int) -> String {
    if x > 0 {
        return "\(x) is a positive number."
    } else if x < 0 {
        return "\(x) is a negative number."
    } else {
        return "That number isn't positive or negative! It's \(x)!"
    }
}

// Now try to call that function at least four different times. Try it with two different positive numbers, two different negative numbers.




// Math bonus: Try to get the third statement to come out by passing in a number that is neither positive nor negative.



// Level 2:
// Create your own function that will tell you whether a number is divisible by three. Hint: You'll probably want to use a % operator at some point to make your life easier.



// Call the function at least three different times - at least once with an argument that is a multiple of three, and at least once with a number that is not, to confirm that it works in both cases.



// Now create a function that tells whether a number is even or odd.



// Call that function three times to confirm that it works.




// Level 3:
// Create your own function that takes in someone's name as a string and returns another string telling whether or not that user's name is short (under 5 letters), medium (between 5-9 letters), or long (10 letters or more).



// Call that function three times with three different name lengths to check if it works.



// Create your own function that prints an invitation to a potluck. It will take in a person's name as a string, and a specific dish to bring as a string, and returns a long string that politely invites them to the potluck.
// For example, if I called inviteToPotluck(name: "Jo", dish: "chips"), it would return a string like "Dear Jo, please join us tomorrow for a potluck. We'd love it if you could bring some chips!"



// Call that function with three different people and food item assignments to confirm that it works.
